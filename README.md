# Brain Tumor Detection System

This project utilizes deep learning to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images. The primary objective is to determine whether a tumor is present and, if so, classify its type with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Dataset Handling**: Prepares and processes the MRI images for training.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for tumor classification.
- **Prediction System**: Detects the presence of a tumor and identifies its type with an accuracy score.
- **Future Prediction**: Provides insights into the likelihood of tumor formation.

## Workflow
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Curated MRI image dataset is preprocessed.
2. **Model Training**: A deep learning model is trained and saved as an `.h5` file for later use.
3. **Prediction**: An MRI image is input, and the system determines:
   - If a tumor is present.
   - The type of tumor and its likelihood.
4. **Results**: Outputs a classification report and accuracy score.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask is used to create the web server and handle requests.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create the user interface for uploading images and displaying results.
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow and Keras libraries are utilized to build and train the CNN model.
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for plotting graphs and visualizing model performance.
- **Database**: SQLite is integrated to store user inputs and results (optional).
- **Deployment**: The app can be deployed on platforms like Heroku or AWS for broader accessibility.

## How the App Works
1. **Input**: The user uploads an MRI image through the web interface.
2. **Processing**:
   - The image is preprocessed and passed to the trained deep learning model.
   - The model predicts whether a tumor is present.
3. **Output**:
   - If a tumor is detected, the app determines the type of tumor and displays the classification along with a confidence score.
   - If no tumor is detected, the app informs the user that the MRI scan appears healthy.
4. **Insights**:
   - The app provides additional insights, such as the likelihood of tumor formation based on the analysis.

## Project Structure
- **app.py**: The main backend script to deploy the trained model and process user requests.
- **project3.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for training and evaluating the CNN model.
- **design.png**: Visual representation of the project's workflow.
- **models/**: Directory for storing saved models (.h5 files).
- **static/**: Static files such as images and CSS for the web interface.
- **templates/**: HTML templates for rendering the web pages.
